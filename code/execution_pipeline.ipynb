Immune system dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity, endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia.

Due to the wide array of PASC presentations6, it is critical to understand if specific features of the disease are associated with discrete immune processes, and whether those processes may be therapeutically targeted. To this end, we performed wide immunologic and serological characterization of patients in the early recovery phase of COVID-19 across a breadth of symptomatic presentations. Using high-parameter proteomics screening and applied machine learning (ML), we identify clear signatures of immunologic activity between PASC patients and uncomplicated recovery, dominated by inflammatory cytokine signaling, neutrophil activity, and markers of cell death. Consistent with disease complexity, heterogeneity in plasma profiling reveals distinct PASC subsets with striking divergence in these ongoing inflammatory processes, here termed plasma quiescent (plaq) and inflammatory (infl) PASC. In addition to elevated inflammatory blood proteomics, inflPASC patients display positive clinical tests of acute inflammation including C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, increased B cell activity with extrafollicular involvement coupled with elevated targeting of viral nucleocapsid protein and clinical autoreactivity. Further, the unique plasma signatures of PASC patients allowed for the creation of refined models with high sensitivity and specificity for the positive identification of inflPASC with a streamlined assessment of 12 blood markers. Additionally, refined ML modeling highlights the unexpected significance of several markers of potential diagnostic or therapeutic use for PASC in general, including the peptide hormone, epiregulin. In all, this work identifies clear biological signatures of PASC with potential diagnostic and therapeutic potential and establishes clear disease subtypes that are both easily identifiable and highly relevant to ongoing efforts in both therapeutic targeting and epidemiological investigation of this highly complex disease.', 'doi': '10.1101/2021.09.21.21263845', 'authors': 'Woodruff, M.; Walker, T.; Truong, A.; Han, J.; Dixit, A.; Ramonell, R.; Runnstrom, M.; Rudoloph, M.; Khosroshahi, A.; Lee, F.

Symptoms, pulmonary function tests and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were compared across groups and to healthy controls. CT images were quantitatively analyzed using supervised machine-learning to measure regional ground glass opacities (GGO) and image-matching to measure regional air trapping. Comparisons were performed using univariate analyses and multivariate linear regression.\\n\\nResultsOf the 100 patients enrolled, 67 were in the ambulatory group. All groups commonly reported cough and dyspnea. Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive physiology in the hospitalized and ICU groups but was normal in the ambulatory group. Among hospitalized and ICU patients, the mean percent of total lung classified as GGO was 13.2% and 28.7%, respectively, and was higher than in ambulatory patients (3.7%, P<0.001). The mean percentage of total lung affected by air trapping was 25.4%, 34.5% and 27.2% in the ambulatory, hospitalized and ICU groups and 7.3% in healthy controls (P<0.001). Air trapping measured by quantitative CT correlated with the residual volume to total lung capacity ratio (RV/TLC; {rho}=0.6, P<0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsAir trapping is present in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and is independent of initial infection severity, suggesting obstruction at the level of the small airways.

The most common symptoms were fatigue (79.0%), headache (55.3%), shortness of breath (55.3%), difficulty concentrating (53.6%), cough (49.0%), changed sense of taste (44.9%), diarrhea (43.9%), and muscle or body aches (43.5%). The timing of symptom onset varied and was best described as happening in waves. The longest lasting symptoms on average for all participants (in days) were \"frequently changing\" symptoms (112.0), inability to exercise (106.5), fatigue (101.7), difficulty concentrating (101.1), memory problems (100.8), sadness (99.2), hormone imbalance (99.1), and shortness of breath (96.9). The symptoms that affected ability to work included the relapsing/remitting nature of illness (described by survivors as \"changing symptoms\"), inability to concentrate, fatigue, and memory problems, among others. Symptoms causing the greatest level of distress (on scale of 1 \"none\" to 5 \"a great deal\") were extreme pressure at the base of the head (4.4), syncope (4.3), sharp or sudden chest pain (4.2), brain pressure (4.2), headache (4.2), persistent chest pain or pressure (4.1), and bone pain in extremities (4.1).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEPASC is an emerging public health priority characterized by a wide range of changing symptoms, which hinder survivors ability to work. PASC has not been fully characterized and the trajectory of symptoms and long-term outcomes are unknown. There is no treatment for PASC, and survivors report distress in addition to a host of ongoing symptoms. Capturing patient reports of symptoms through open-ended inquiry is a critical first step in accurately and comprehensively characterizing PASC to ensure that medical treatments and management strategies best meet the needs of individual patients and help mitigate health impacts of this new disease.', 'doi': '10.1101/2021.03.22.21254026', 'authors': 'Lambert, N.; Survivor Corps,  ; El-Azab, S.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that drive this inflammation remain unknown. Inflammation during acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be exacerbated by microbial translocation (from the gut and/or lung) to the blood. Whether microbial translocation contributes to inflammation during PASC is unknown. We found higher levels of fungal translocation - measured as {beta}-glucan, a fungal cell wall polysaccharide - in the plasma of individuals experiencing PASC compared to those without PASC or SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. The higher {beta}-glucan correlated with higher levels of markers of inflammation and elevated levels of host metabolites involved in activating N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (such as metabolites within the tryptophan catabolism pathway) with established neuro-toxic properties. Mechanistically, {beta}-glucan can directly induce inflammation by binding to myeloid cells (via the Dectin-1 receptor) and activating Syk/NF-{kappa}B signaling. Using an in vitro Dectin-1/NF-{kappa}B reporter model, we found that plasma from individuals experiencing PASC induced higher NF-{kappa}B signaling compared to plasma from SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. This higher NF-{kappa}B signaling was abrogated by the Syk inhibitor Piceatannol.

Current evidence suggests a dysregulated alveolar regeneration in COVID-19 as a possible explanation for respiratory PASC symptoms, a phenomenon which deserves further investigation in a suitable animal model. This study investigates morphological, phenotypical and transcriptomic features of alveolar regeneration in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian golden hamsters. We demonstrate that CK8+ alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells occur following SARS-CoV-2-induced diffuse alveolar damage. A subset of ADI cells shows nuclear accumulation of TP53 at 6- and 14-days post infection (dpi), indicating a prolonged arrest in the ADI state. Transcriptome data show the expression of gene signatures driving ADI cell senescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. Moreover, we show that multipotent CK14+ airway basal cell progenitors migrate out of terminal bronchioles, aiding alveolar regeneration. At 14 dpi, presence of ADI cells, peribronchiolar proliferates, M2-type macrophages, and sub-pleural fibrosis is observed, indicating incomplete alveolar restoration. The results demonstrate that the hamster model reliably phenocopies indicators of a dysregulated alveolar regeneration of COVID-19 patients.

The primary clinical outcome was the presence of self-reported central nervous system (CNS) PASC symptoms during the late recovery timepoint. We compared fold-changes in marker values between those with and without CNS PASC symptoms using linear mixed effects models and examined relationships between neurologic and immunologic markers using rank linear correlations.\\n\\nResultsOf 121 individuals, 52 reported CNS PASC symptoms. During early recovery, those who went on to report CNS PASC symptoms had elevations in GFAP (1.3-fold higher mean ratio, 95% CI 1.04-1.63, p=0.02), but not NfL (1.06-fold higher mean ratio, 95% CI 0.89-1.26, p=0.54). During late recovery, neither GFAP nor NfL levels were elevated among those with CNS PASC symptoms. Although absolute levels of NfL did not differ, those who reported CNS PASC symptoms demonstrated a stronger downward trend over time in comparison to those who did not report CNS PASC symptoms (p=0.041). Those who went on to report CNS PASC also exhibited elevations in IL-6 (48% higher during early recovery and 38% higher during late recovery), MCP-1 (19% higher during early recovery), and TNF-alpha (19% higher during early recovery and 13% higher during late recovery).

Additionally, the subscales were assessed for targeting, reliability and unidimensionality. The overall health subscale is a single item, and the additional symptoms subscale is not intended to be summed, therefore neither is appropriate for Rasch analyses.

Adult patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were systematically assessed through a semi-structured and validated survey. Total IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. Out of a total of 100 consecutive patients, 53 were women, the median of age was 49 years (IQR: 37.8 to 55.3), the median of post-COVID time after the first symptoms was 219 days (IQR: 143 to 258), and 65 patients were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. Musculoskeletal, digestive (i.e., diarrhea) and neurological symptoms including depression (by Zung scale) were the most frequent observed in PCS patients. A previous hospitalization was not associated with PCS manifestation. Arthralgia and diarrhea persisted in more than 40% of PCS patients. The median of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 866.2 U/mL (IQR: 238.2 to 1681). Despite this variability, 98 patients were seropositive.

These included 16 studies attempting manual sub-grouping of phenotypes, 6 deployments of unsupervised methods for patient clustering and automatic semantic phenotyping (unsupervised k-means=2; random forest classification=1; other=2), and two reports of uncommon presentations of Long-COVID/post-COVID syndrome. Overall, two to eight symptom profiles (clusters) were identified, with three recurring clusters. A cardiopulmonary syndrome was the predominant observation, manifesting with exertional intolerance and dyspnoea (n=10), fatigue (n=8), autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia or palpitations (n=5), lung radiological abnormalities including fibrosis (n=2), and chest pain (n=1). A second common presentation consisted in persistent general autoimmune activation and proinflammatory state (n=2), comprising multi-organ mild sequelae (n=2), gastrointestinal symptoms (n=2), dermatological symptoms (n=2), and/or fever (n=1). A third syndrome was reported, with neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms: brain fog or dizziness (n=2), poor memory or cognition (n=2), and other mental health issues including mood disorders (n=5), headache (n=2), central sensitization (n=1), paresthesia (n=1), autonomic dysfunction (n=1), fibromyalgia (n=2), and chronic pain or myalgias (n=6). Unsupervised clustering methods identified two to six different post-COVID phenotypes, mapping to the ones described above.\\n\\n14 further documents focused on possible causes and/or mechanisms of disease underlying one or more manifestations of Long-COVID or post-COVID and identifying immune response dysregulation as a potential common element. All the other documents were beyond the scope of this work.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, there are no studies examining the symptom profile of post-COVID syndrome between different variants and vaccination status. Also, no studies reported the modelling of longitudinally collected symptoms, as time-series data, aiming at the characterisation of post-COVID syndrome.\\n\\nAdded-value of this studyOur study aimed to identify symptom profiles for post-COVID syndrome across the dominant variants in 2020 and 2021, and across vaccination status at the time of infection, using a large sample with prospectively collected longitudinal self-reports of symptoms. For individuals developing 12 weeks or more of symptoms, we identified three main symptom profiles which were consistent across variants and by vaccination status, differing only in the ratio of individuals affected by each profile and symptom duration overall.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceWe demonstrate the existence of different post-COVID syndromes, which share commonalities across SARS-CoV-2 variant types in both symptoms themselves and how they evolved through the illness. We describe subgroups of patients with specific post-COVID presentations which might reflect different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Given the time-series component, our study is relevant for post-COVID prognostication, indicating how long certain symptoms last. These insights could aid in the development of personalised diagnosis and treatment, as well as helping policymakers plan for the delivery of care for people living with post-COVID syndrome.', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.07.28.22278159', 'authors': 'Canas, L.

Electronic health record (EHR) studies are a critical element of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand PASC, accurately identify who has PASC, and identify treatments.\\n\\nMethodsUsing the National COVID Cohort Collaboratives (N3C) EHR repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning (ML) models to identify potential long-COVID patients. We examined demographics, healthcare utilization, diagnoses, and medications for 97,995 adult COVID-19 patients. We used these features and 597 long-COVID clinic patients to train three ML models to identify potential long-COVID patients among (1) all COVID-19 patients, (2) patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and (3) patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalized.\\n\\nFindingsOur models identified potential long-COVID patients with high accuracy, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.91 (all patients), 0.90 (hospitalized); and 0.85 (non-hospitalized).

The number of adversity experiences (e.g., job loss) and the number of worries about adversity experiences within the month prior to COVID-19 infection were used to predict the development of self-reported long COVID and the presence of three specific long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). The interaction between a three-level index of socio-economic position (SEP; with higher values indicating lower SEP) and the exposure variables in relation to long COVID status was also examined.

Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full text. We included studies reporting on 1- persons living with Long COVID and 2- proposing a specific care model (i.e., dedicated clinic, care pathway). We extracted characteristic of studies (e.g., countries, study design, age group), referral pathways targeted (e.g., hospitalized, community), reporting of the care model implementation with number of patients, clinical settings of care model (e.g., primary care), healthcare professions included in the care model, care model principles (e.g., person-centred care) and care model components (e.g., standardized symptoms assessment).

Half studies were from the United Kingdom. 7 out of 12 models reported conceptual models without a description of implementation. All but one model was designed for discharge and long-term follow-up of hospitalized patients and half models were designed for non- hospitalized or patients who lived with the disease only in the community. Nine out of 12 care models included primary care, 8 out of 12 included specialized clinics and all studies included rehabilitation services. A total of 30 healthcare professions and medical specialties were proposed for staffing Long COVID services. More than half studies proposed multidisciplinary teams, integrated/coordination of care, evidence-based care and patient-centred care as key care model principles. Standardized symptom assessment, follow-up system and virtual care were the most frequent care model components.\\n\\nConclusionThe implementation of care models for Long COVID is underway in several countries. Care models need to include both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. A complete care model for this population appears to design a care pathway integrating primary care, rehabilitation services and specialized clinics for medical assessment.

Marked differences were noted in specific circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations relative to matched control groups, as well as evidence of elevated humoral responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 among participants with Long COVID. Further, unexpected increases were observed in antibody responses directed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens, particularly Epstein-Barr virus. Analysis of circulating immune mediators and various hormones also revealed pronounced differences, with levels of cortisol being uniformly lower among participants with Long COVID relative to matched control groups. Integration of immune phenotyping data into unbiased machine learning models identified significant distinguishing features critical in accurate classification of Long COVID, with decreased levels of cortisol being the most significant individual predictor. These findings will help guide additional studies into the pathobiology of Long COVID and may aid in the future development of objective biomarkers for Long COVID.', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.08.09.22278592', 'authors': 'Klein, J.; Wood, J.; Jaycox, J.; Lu, P.; Dhodapkar, R.

The pathophysiology of Long-COVID remains to be established. Functional P-selectin activity, implicated in COVID-19 sequalae, was measured between two convalescent COVID-19 subjects, one with (Long-COVID subject) and another without Long-COVID symptoms.\\n\\nMethodsFlow adhesion of whole blood or isolated white blood cells to P-selectin (FA-WB-Psel and FA-WBC-Psel) was measured using a standardized microfluidics clinical assay; impedance aggregometry with a collagen agonist was measured using model 590 Chrono-Log impedance aggregometer; standard laboratory assays were performed to evaluate changes in blood chemistries.\\n\\nResultsFor both subjects, hemoglobin, WBC, platelet counts, electrolytes and ferritin were within normal reference ranges, with FA-WB-Psel significantly elevated compared to healthy controls (p< 0.01). In vitro treatment of whole blood samples with crizanlizumab (anti-p-selectin monoclonal antibody) within the clinical dose range (10 g/ml) mL) inhibited FA-WB-Psel only in samples from asymptomatic post-COVID subject, with the Long-COVID subject sample requiring close to 5-fold elevated dose to achieve a response. Pronounced inhibition of P-selectin adhesion of isolated leukocytes was observed for both subjects in autologous platelet-poor plasma and buffer. Impedance aggregometry showed greater baseline platelet aggregation to collagen in the Long-COVID sample, although both samples responded similarly to aspirin-induced platelet inhibition.\\n\\nConclusionsPresented results suggest that elevated platelet activation in Long-COVID subject may be associated with increased P-Selectin activity.

Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.\\n\\nMethodsAn ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions.\\n\\nFindingsBetween April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms.\\n\\nThere was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%).

Long Covid has emerged as a major public health concern that needs defining, quantifying, and describing. We aimed to explore the initial and ongoing symptoms of Long Covid following SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe its impact on daily life in people who were not admitted to hospital during the first two weeks of the illness. We co-produced a survey with people living with Long Covid. We collected the data through an online survey using convenience non-probability sampling, with the survey posted both specifically on Long Covid support groups and generally on social media. The criteria for inclusion were adults with lab-confirmed (PCR or antibody) or suspected COVID-19 managed in the community (non-hospitalised) in the first two weeks of illness. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify specific symptom clusters, and their demographic and functional correlates.\\n\\nWe analysed data from 2550 participants with a median duration of illness of 7.7 months (interquartile range (IQR) 7.4-8.0). The mean age was 46.5 years (standard deviation 11 years) with 82.8% females and 79.9% of participants based in the UK. 89.5% described their health as good, very good or excellent before COVID-19. The most common initial symptoms that persisted were exhaustion, chest pressure/tightness, shortness of breath and headache. Cough, fever, and chills were common initial symptoms that became less prevalent later in the illness, whereas cognitive dysfunction and palpitations became more prevalent later in the illness. 26.5% reported lab-confirmation of infection. The biggest difference in ongoing symptoms between those who reported testing positive and those who did not was loss of smell/taste. Ongoing symptoms affected at least 3 organ systems in 83.5% of participants.\\n\\nMost participants described fluctuating (57.7%) or relapsing symptoms (17.6%). Physical activity, stress and sleep disturbance commonly triggered symptoms. A third (32%) reported they were unable to live alone without any assistance at six weeks from start of illness. 16.9% reported being unable to work solely due to COVID-19 illness. 66.4% reported taking time off sick (median of 60 days, IQR 20, 129). 37.0% reported loss of income due to illness, and 64.4% said they were unable to perform usual activities/duties.\\n\\nAcute systems clustered broadly into two groups: a majority cluster (n=2235, 88%) with cardiopulmonary predominant symptoms, and a minority cluster (n=305, 12%) with multisystem symptoms. Similarly, ongoing symptoms broadly clustered in two groups; a majority cluster (n=2243, 88.8%) exhibiting mainly cardiopulmonary, cognitive symptoms and exhaustion, and a minority cluster (n=283, 11.2%) exhibited more multisystem symptoms. Belonging to the more severe multisystem cluster was associated with more severe functional impact, lower income, younger age, being female, worse baseline health, and inadequate rest in the first two weeks of the illness, with no major differences in the cluster patterns when restricting analysis to the lab-confirmed subgroup.\\n\\nThis is an exploratory survey of Long Covid characteristics. Whilst it is important to acknowledge that it is a non-representative population sample, it highlights the heterogeneity of persistent symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness following confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Accurate identification of phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective electronic health records (EHR) cohort study, we applied a computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. We evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3-6 and 6-9 months after the test and by age and gender. Data from longitudinal diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham in the Boston metropolitan area was used for the analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on data from March 2020 to June 2021. Study participants included over 96 thousand patients who had tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and were not hospitalized. We identified 33 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows that were positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified phenotypes were newly recorded in patients medical records two months or longer after a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and dysgeusia (OR: 2.60, 95% CI [1.94 - 3.46]), alopecia (OR: 3.09, 95% CI [2.53 - 3.76]), chest pain (OR: 1.27, 95% CI [1.09 - 1.48]), chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.22-2.10]), shortness of breath (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22 - 1.64]), pneumonia (OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.28 - 2.16]), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22 - 1.64]) are some of the most significant indicators of a past COVID-19 infection.

Our approach avoids a flood of false positive discoveries while offering a more robust probabilistic approach compared to the standard linear phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). The findings of this study confirm many of the post-COVID symptoms and suggest that a variety of new diagnoses, including new diabetes mellitus and neurological disorder diagnoses, are more common among those with a history of COVID-19 than those without the infection.

Anecdotal reports have suggested both a potential benefit and worsening of symptoms post vaccination with the uncertainty leading to some vaccine hesitancy amongst affected individuals.\\n\\nMethodsPatients initially hospitalised with COVID-19 were prospectively recruited to an observational study with clinical follow-up at 3 months (June-July 2020) and 8 months (Dec 2020-Jan 2021) post-admission. Participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine between January to February 2021 were identified and matched 2:1 (in terms of 8-month symptoms) with participants from the same cohort who were unvaccinated. All were re-assessed at 1 month post vaccination (or matched timepoint for unvaccinated cohort). Validated quality of life (SF-36), mental wellbeing (WEMWBS) and ongoing symptoms were assessed at all timepoints. Formal statistical analysis compared the effect of vaccination on recent quality of life using baseline symptoms, age, and gender in linear regression.\\n\\nResultsForty-four vaccinated participants were assessed at a median of 32 days (IQR 20-41) post vaccination with 22 matched unvaccinated participants. Most were highly symptomatic of Long Covid at 8 months (82% in both groups had at least 1 persistent symptom), with fatigue (61%), breathlessness (50%) and insomnia (38%) predominating. There was no significant worsening in quality-of-life or mental wellbeing metrics pre versus post vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (n=27) reported transient (<72hr duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache).\\n\\nWhen compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had receive a vaccine had a small overall improvement in Long Covid symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.\\n\\nConclusionsReceipt of vaccination with either an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine was not associated with a worsening of Long Covid symptoms, quality of life, or mental wellbeing.

The clinical definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of Long COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for Long COVID in the US took nearly two years after patients had begun to describe their condition.

In addition, the generalizability of machine learning classification of COVID-19 clinical outcomes has rarely been tested. We present a method for computationally modeling PASC phenotype data based on electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and for assessing pairwise phenotypic similarity between patients using semantic similarity. Our approach defines a nonlinear similarity function that maps from a feature space of phenotypic abnormalities to a matrix of pairwise patient similarity that can be clustered using unsupervised machine learning procedures. Using k-means clustering of this similarity matrix, we found six distinct clusters of PASC patients, each with distinct profiles of phenotypic abnormalities. There was a significant association of cluster membership with a range of pre-existing conditions and with measures of severity during acute COVID-19. Two of the clusters were associated with severe manifestations and displayed increased mortality. We assigned new patients from other healthcare centers to one of the six clusters on the basis of maximum semantic similarity to the original patients. We show that the identified clusters were generalizable across different hospital systems and that the increased mortality rate was consistently observed in two of the clusters.

In a cohort of 280 adults with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed that LC symptoms such as fatigue and neurocognitive dysfunction at a median of 4 months following initial diagnosis were independently associated with serological evidence of recent EBV reactivation (early antigen-D [EA-D] IgG positivity) or high nuclear antigen IgG levels, but not with ongoing EBV viremia.

Non-pharmacological treatments for these symptoms are poorly understood. This review summarises evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for symptoms of PVS. It also summarises the symptoms and health impacts of PVS in individuals recruited to studies evaluating treatments.\\n\\nMethods and findingsWe conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for PVS, as compared to either standard care, alternative non-pharmacological therapy, or placebo. The outcomes of interest were changes in symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life (including mental health and wellbeing), and work capability. We searched five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, MedRxiv) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1st January 2001 to 29th October 2021. We anticipated that there would be few RCTs specifically pertaining to Long COVID, so we also included observational studies only if they assessed interventions in individuals where the viral pathogen was SARS-COV-2. Relevant outcome data were extracted, study quality appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the findings were synthesised narratively. Quantitative synthesis was not planned due to substantial heterogeneity between the studies. Overall, five studies of five different interventions (Pilates, music therapy, telerehabilitation, resistance exercise, neuromodulation) met the inclusion criteria. Aside from music-based intervention, all other selected interventions demonstrated some support in the management of PVS in some patients.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study, we observed a lack of robust evidence evaluating non-pharmacological treatments for PVS, including Long COVID.

Resolving a polyclonal antibody repertoire across a pathogens proteome to specific epitopes may therefore explain much of the heterogeneity in susceptibility to infectious disease. However, the three-dimensional nature of antibody-epitope interactions makes the discovery of non-obvious targets challenging. We implemented a novel computational method and synthetic biology pipeline for identifying epitopes that are functionally important in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified an IgM-dominant response to an exposed Membrane protein epitope which to our knowledge is the strongest correlate of severe disease identified to date (adjusted OR 72.14, 95% CI: 9.71 - 1300.15), stronger even than the exponential association of severe disease with age. We also identify persistence (> 2 years) of this IgM response in individuals with longCOVID, and a correlation with fatigue and depression symptom burden. The repetitive arrangement of this epitope and the pattern of isotype class switching is consistent with this being a previously unrecognized T independent antigen. These findings point to a coronavirus host-pathogen interaction characteristic of severe virus driven immune pathology. This epitope is a promising vaccine and therapeutic target as it is highly conserved through SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in humans to date and in related coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV), showing far less evolutionary plasticity than targets on the Spike protein. This provides a promising biomarker for longCOVID and a target to complement Spike-directed vaccination which could broaden humoral protection from severe or persistent disease or novel coronavirus spillovers.\\n\\nOne-Sentence SummaryUsing a novel protein-structure-based B cell epitope discovery method with a wide range of possible applications, we have identified a simple to measure host-pathogen antibody signature associated with severe COVID-19 and longCOVID and suggest the viral Membrane protein contains an epitope that acts as a T independent antigen during infection triggering extrafollicular B cell activation.', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.07.11.22277368', 'authors': 'Kearns, P.

A recent clinical analysis revealed that under certain conditions, a patients disease symptoms are more likely to persist. Long COVID is characterised by many symptoms that continue long after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has resolved. This work utilised computational methods to analyse the persistence of COVID symptoms after recovery and to identify the relevant genes. Based on functional similarity, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 255 symptoms of long covid were examined, and potential genes were identified based on the rank of functional similarity. Then, hub genes were identified by analysing the interactions between proteins. Using the identified key genes and the drug-gene interaction score, FDA drugs with potential for possible alternatives were identified. Also discovered were the gene ontology and pathways for 255 distinct symptoms. A website (https://longcovid.omicstutorials.com/) with a list of significant genes identified as biomarkers and potential treatments for each symptom was created. All of the hub genes associated with the symptoms, GNGT1, GNG12, GNB3, GNB4, GNG13, GNG8, GNG3, GNG7, GNG10, and GNAI1, were discovered to be associated with G-protein coupled receptors. This demonstrates that persistent COVID infection affects various organ systems and promotes chronic inflammation following infection. CTLA4, PTPN22, KIT, KRAS, NF1, RET, and CTNNB1 were identified as the common genes that regulate T-cell immunity via GPCR and cause a variety of symptoms, including autoimmunity, cardiovascular, dermatological, general symptoms, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, reproductive, genitourinary, and endocrine symptoms (RGEM). Among other functions, they were found to be involved in the positive regulation of protein localization to the cell cortex, the regulation of triglyceride metabolism, the binding of G protein-coupled receptors, the binding of G protein-coupled serotonin receptors, the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, and the cell cortex region.

Few systematic studies exist which investigate this population, and hence, relatively little is known about the range in symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and expected return to baseline health. In this study, we analysed responses from 3,762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1,020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2,742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness duration of at least 28 days. 3608 (96%) reported symptoms beyond 90 days. Prevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over seven months. Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. Respondents experienced an average of 14.5 symptoms in an average of 9.08 organ systems. Three clusters of symptoms were identified based on their prevalence over time. The most likely early symptoms were fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath, headaches, muscle aches, chest tightness, and sore throat. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Majority (>85%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 1,700 (45.2%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 839 (22.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementResults from our international online survey of 3,762 individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness suggest that Long COVID is composed of heterogeneous post-acute infection sequelae that often affect multiple organ systems, with impact on functioning and quality of life ranging from mild to severe. This study represents the largest collection of symptoms identified in the Long COVID population to date, and is the first to quantify individual symptom trajectory over time, for 7 months. Three clusters of symptoms were quantified, each with different morphologies over time. The clusters of symptoms that persist longest include a combination of the neurological/cognitive and systemic symptoms. The reduced work capacity because of cognitive dysfunction, in addition to other debilitating symptoms, translated into the loss of hours, jobs, and ability to work relative to pre-illness levels.\\n\\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSTo characterize the symptom profile and time course in patients with Long COVID, along with the impact on daily life, work, and return to baseline health.\\n\\nDesignInternational web-based survey of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020.\\n\\nSettingSurvey distribution via online COVID-19 support groups and social media\\n\\nParticipants3,762 respondents from 56 countries completed the survey. 1166 (31.0%) were 40-49 years old, 937 (25.0%) were 50-59 years old, 905 (24.1%) were 30-39 years old, 277 (7.4%) were 18-29 years old, and 477 (12.7%) were above 60 years old. 2961 (78.9%) were women, 718 (19.1%) were men, and 63 (1.7%) were nonbinary. 317 (8.4%) reported being hospitalized. 1020 (27.1%) reported receiving a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 3608 (96%) reported symptoms beyond 90 days.\\n\\nResultsPrevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over seven months. Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all other symptoms are similar between confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive) and suspected groups (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested). Respondents experienced symptoms in an average of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 9.04 to 9.13) organ systems. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were: fatigue (77.7%, 74.9% to 80.3%), post-exertional malaise (72.2%, 69.3% to 75.0%), and cognitive dysfunction (55.4%, 52.4% to 58.8%). These three symptoms were also the three most commonly reported overall. In those who recovered in less than 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at week 2 (11.4, 9.4 to 13.6), and in those who did not recover in 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at month 2 (17.2, 16.5 to 17.8). Respondents with symptoms over 6 months experienced an average of 13.8 (12.7 to 14.9) symptoms in month 7. 85.9% (84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 45.2% (42.9% to 47.2%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 22.3% (20.5% to 24.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.\\n\\nConclusionsPatients with Long COVID report prolonged multisystem involvement and significant disability.

The UK Government willingness-to-pay to avoid these QALY losses would be {pound}17.9 billion and {pound}32.2 billion, respectively. Additionally, 90,143 people were subject to permanent injury from COVID-19 (0.14% of the population).\\n\\nConclusionGiven the ongoing development in information in this area, we present a model framework for calculating the health economic impacts of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model framework can aid in quantifying the adverse health impact of COVID-19, long COVID and permanent injury following COVID-19 in society and assist the proactive management of risk posed to health.

A conceptual framework and initial item pool were developed from published systematic reviews. Further concept elicitation and content validation was undertaken with adults with lived experience (n = 13) and clinicians (n = 10), and face validity was confirmed by the Therapies for Long COVID Study Patient and Public Involvement group (n = 25). The draft SBQ-LC was field tested by adults with self-reported Long COVID recruited via social media and international Long COVID support groups (n = 274). Thematic analysis of interview and survey transcripts established content validity and informed construction of the draft questionnaire. Rasch analysis of field test data guided item and scale refinement and provided evidence of the final SBQ-LCs measurement properties. The Rasch-derived SBQ-LC is composed of 17 independent scales with promising psychometric properties. Respondents rate symptom burden during the past 7-days using a dichotomous response or 4-point rating scale. Each scale provides coverage of a different symptom domain and returns a summed raw score that may be converted to a linear (0 - 100) score. Higher scores represent higher symptom burden.\\n\\nConclusionsThe SBQ-LC is a comprehensive patient-reported assessment of Long COVID symptom burden developed using modern psychometric methods. It measures symptoms of Long COVID important to individuals with lived experience and may be used to evaluate the impact of interventions and inform best practice in clinical management.', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.01.16.22269146', 'authors': 'Hughes, S.

We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of illness uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasised, participants reported longer expected symptom duration, less treatment control, and less illness coherence than when uncertainty was not emphasised. There was also a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control and higher treatment control when support was enhanced (compared to basic support). We also found an interaction between illness description and efficacy of support: when support was enhanced, participants reported less illness coherence for Long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery).\\n\\nConclusionsCommunications around Long COVID should not emphasise symptom uncertainty and should provide people with information on how they can facilitate their recovery and where they can access additional support.

On the 6 months follow up, their lung function was assessed by CT and spirometry, whereas cardiac function was assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter ECG, Echocardiography, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. A six-minute test (6MWT) was conducted on 308 participants during the follow-up visit. All participants were given a questionnaire with items on demographic information, current complaints, comorbidities, and medications, and Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done using R vs. 4.1.2. Two-group comparison of continuous variables was performed using a T-test for normally distributed data, and the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied for multiple comparisons following with Tukey and Dunn tests as post-hoc methods. Hochberg p-value adjustment was used to reduce the false discovery rate during multiple comparisons. Categorical variables were analyzed with Fishers Exact test.\\n\\nResultsOf 312 persons investigated, there was no significant gender difference between post-COVID-19 clinical manifestations except for memory dysfunction and anxiety, more prevalent among female participants.

We aimed to characterise patterns of COVID-19 and long COVID symptoms across nine UK longitudinal studies, totalling over 42,000 participants. Conducting latent class analyses separately in three groups ( no COVID-19,  COVID-19 in last 12 weeks,  COVID-19 > 12 weeks ago), the data did not support the presence of more than two distinct symptom patterns, representing high and low symptom burden, in each group.

The overlap in neurological-based symptoms and neuroinflammatory origin indicates that the framework of post-concussion syndrome may provide insight into new diagnostics and treatment for patients with Long COVID. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether tools from the four common domains of concussion assessment were sensitive to differentiate between patients with Long COVID from a reference group who was infected with Sars-CoV-2 and does not have Long COVID.\\n\\nMethodsIn this prospective cohort design, each participant self reported their group (Acute, n=28) and Long COVID Group (n=33). Each participant underwent an examination in four assessment categories: symptoms, vestibular nystagmography, Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM), and a series of balance tasks.\\n\\nResultsTotal Symptom scores were separated into functional classifications and showed clear success as a tool to differentiate between Acute and Long COVID. Five of the 33 people in the Long COVID had detectable central lesions, which increases the risk of developing long COVID by 64% (Relative Risk=1.64). A wide variety of objective and quantitative measures from post-concussion care are sensitive to the Long COVID condition. Prolonged latency during random saccades eye tracking was present (p<0.01, d=0.87) in the Long COVID group corresponding to the King-Devick rapid reading test, which was highly sensitive to Long COVID (p<0.01, d=1.34). ANAM reaction time subtests had similarly large effects (p<0.01, d=0.93-1.09). Balance performance with corrupted sensory feedback was also sensitive (p<0.01, d=0.96).\\n\\nDiscussionOur results indicate that long-standing and validated post-concussion symptom questionnaires may be used for quantifying the severity of Long COVID. Some of the most sensitive measures (especially the King-Devick rapid reading test) are easy to implement clinically and may be effective at tracking patient progress in the context of Long COVID treatment. The results point to wide deficits in motor integration and provide a rationale for treating the subset of Long COVID patients with similar rehabilitation strategies as patients with post-concussion syndrome.', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.09.24.22280310', 'authors': 'Davidson, B.; Noteboom, L.; Pierro, H.; Kantor, C.; Stoot, D.; Stoot, F.; Linseman, D.; Hale, T.; Gorgens, K.', 'author_corresponding_institution': 'University of Denver', 'category': 'neurology'}}, {'_index': 'uasb03_unique_full', '_id': '10.1101/2022.10.13.22281055', '_score': 6.854787, '_ignored': ['abstract.keyword'], '_source': {'title': 'Increased levels of inflammatory molecules in blood of Long COVID patients point to thrombotic endotheliitis', 'abstract': 'The prevailing hypotheses for the persistent symptoms of Long COVID have been narrowed down to immune dysregulation and autoantibodies, widespread organ damage, viral persistence, and fibrinaloid microclots (entrapping numerous inflammatory molecules) together with platelet hyperactivation. Here we demonstrate significantly increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor, platelet factor 4,serum amyloid A, -2antiplasmin E-selectin, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, in the soluble part of the blood. It was noteworthy that the mean level of -2-antiplasmin exceeded the upper limit of the laboratory reference range in Long COVID patients, and the other 5 were significantly elevated in Long COVID patients as compared to the controls. This is alarming if we take into consideration that a significant amount of the total burden of these inflammatory molecules has previously been shown to be entrapped inside fibrinolysis-resistant microclots (thus decreasing the apparent level of the soluble molecules). We also determined that by individually adding E-selectin and PECAM-1 to healthy blood, these molecules may indeed be involved in protein-protein interactions with plasma proteins (contributing to microclot formation) and platelet hyperactivation. This investigation was performed as a laboratory model investigation and the final exposure concentration of these molecules was chosen to mimic concentrations found in Long COVID. We conclude that presence of microclotting, together with relatively high levels of six inflammatory molecules known to be key drivers of endothelial and clotting pathology, points to thrombotic endotheliitis as a key pathological process in Long COVID.

The purpose of this study is to assess post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) in cancer patients following acute COVID-19 recovery.\\n\\nMethodsWe identified cancer patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between March 1, 2020 and Sept 1, 2020 and followed them till May 2021. To assess PASC, we collected patients reported outcomes through questionnaires that were sent to patients daily for 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis then weekly for 3 months, and then monthly thereafter. We also reviewed patients electronic medical records to capture the the persistence or emergence of new COVID19-related symptoms reported during any clinic or hospital encounter beyond 30 days of the acute illness and up to 14 months.\\n\\nResultsWe included 312 cancer patients with a median age of 57 years (18-86). The majority of patients had solid tumors (75%). Of the 312 patients, 188 (60%) reported long COVID-19 symptoms with a median duration of 7 months and up to 14 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. The most common symptoms reported included fatigue (82%), sleep disturbances (78%), myalgias (67%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (61%), followed by headache, altered smell or taste, dyspnea (47%) and cough (46%). A higher number of females reported a persistence of symptoms compared to males (63% vs 37%; p=0.036).

Eight months after enrolment, participants completed an online questionnaire including 72 symptoms in the preceding month. Symptomatic mild-to-moderate cases with confirmed COVID-19 were compared with asymptomatic, seronegative controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent symptoms associated with long COVID.\\n\\nFindingsAll 2,147 participants were contacted and 1,671 (77.8%) completed the questionnaire, including 140 (8.4%) cases and 1,160 controls. At a median of 7.5 (IQR 7.1-7.8) months after infection, 20 cases (14.3%) had ongoing (4/140, 2.9%) or episodic (16/140, 11.4%) symptoms. We identified three clusters of symptoms associated with long COVID, those affecting the sensory (ageusia, anosmia, loss of appetite and blurred vision), neurological (forgetfulness, short-term memory loss and confusion/brain fog) and cardiorespiratory (chest tightness/pain, unusual fatigue, breathlessness after minimal exertion/at rest, palpitations) systems.

Most reports included a small number of cases. Larger studies included very specific cohorts, including hospitalised cases and self-selected participants with COVID-19. A systematic review identified 15 studies and, using a broad case definition, concluded that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%), but no assessment was made of these symptoms in uninfected adults.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyIn a prospective, longitudinal cohort of clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers recruited at the start of the pandemic, we found that most self-reported symptoms were as common in 140 adults who developed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 more than 6 months previously compared to 1,160 controls who were asymptomatic and SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative throughout the surveillance period. Compared to controls, we identified three clusters of symptoms affecting the sensory, neurological and cardiorespiratory systems that were more prevalent among cases. Notably, symptoms affecting other organ systems were as prevalent among cases as controls. The high proportion of cases and controls reporting mental health symptoms highlights the toll that the pandemic has had on healthcare workers\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur findings highlight the importance of including a representative cohort of cases to assess long-term outcomes of COVID-19 as well as appropriate controls to estimate the relative prevalence of self-reported symptoms to accurately define this new syndrome.

We analyzed patients referred from a pulmonary post-COVID clinic that were lacking a specific cardiopulmonary diagnosis for their symptoms. Additionally, we report the functional outcomes of subset of patients who completed an outpatient cardiopulmonary physical therapy program.\\n\\nMethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study (n = 58) of consecutive patients referred for neuromuscular ultrasound assessment of diaphragm muscle using B-mode technique.

Thinner diaphragm muscles are correlated with lower serum creatinine and creatine kinase values, but there was no association with markers of systemic inflammation. Thirty three patients participated in outpatient cardiopulmonary physical therapy that included respiratory muscle training, and 75.8% (25/33) had documented improvement.\\n\\nDiscussionIn the outpatient rehabilitation setting, patients with Long COVID display low diaphragm muscle thickness, but intact muscle contractility, with surprising frequency on neuromuscular ultrasound.

In a subset of patients, Long COVID is associated with immune system perturbations of unknown etiology, which could be related to compromised immunoregulatory mechanisms.\\n\\nObjectiveThe aim of this scoping review was to investigate if regulatory T cell (Treg) dysregulation is observable beyond the acute illness and if it might be involved in Long COVID immunopathology.\\n\\nDesignA systematic search of studies investigating Tregs during COVID-19 convalescence was conducted on MEDLINE (via Pubmed) and Web of Science.\\n\\nResultsThe literature search yielded 17 relevant studies, of which three included a distinct cohort of patients with Long COVID. The reviewed studies suggest that the Treg population of COVID-19 patients can reconstitute quantitatively and functionally during recovery. However, the comparison between recovered and seronegative controls revealed that an infection-induced dysregulation of the Treg compartment can be sustained for at least several months. The small number of studies investigating Tregs in Long COVID allowed no firm conclusions to be drawn about their involvement in the syndromes etiology. Yet, even almost one year post-infection Long COVID patients exhibit significantly altered proportions of Tregs within the CD4+ T cell population.\\n\\nConclusionsPersistent alterations in cell frequency in Long COVID patients indicate that Treg dysregulation might be linked to immune system-associated sequelae.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 266 COVID patients to compare those that were admitted/re-admitted post-viral clearance (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=93) with those that were hospitalized pre-clearance but were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=173).

Whilst often considered a respiratory disease, a large proportion of COVID-19 patients report neurological symptoms, and there is accumulating evidence for neural damage in some individuals, with recent studies suggesting loss of gray matter in multiple regions, particularly in the left hemisphere. There are a number of mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection may lead to neurological symptoms and structural and functional changes in the brain, and it is reasonable to expect that many of these may translate into cognitive problems.

Finally, we explore which factors predict the presence and severity of cognitive symptoms, both throughout the ongoing illness and at the time of testing. The main finding from this first analysis is that that severity of initial illness is a significant predictor of the presence and severity of ongoing symptoms, and that some symptoms during the acute illness--particularly limb weakness--may be more common in those that have more severe ongoing symptoms. Symptom profiles can be well described in terms of 5 or 6 factors, reflecting the variety of this highly heterogenous condition suffered by the individual.

This is popularly known as long COVID.\\n\\nObjectiveTo estimate by country and territory of the number of patients affected by long COVID in 2020 and 2021, the severity of their symptoms and expected pattern of recovery\\n\\nDesignWe jointly analyzed ten ongoing cohort studies in ten countries for the occurrence of three major symptom clusters of long COVID among representative COVID cases. The defining symptoms of the three clusters (fatigue, cognitive problems, and shortness of breath) are explicitly mentioned in the WHO clinical case definition. For incidence of long COVID, we adopted the minimum duration after infection of three months from the WHO case definition. We pooled data from the contributing studies, two large medical record databases in the United States, and findings from 44 published studies using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We separately estimated occurrence and pattern of recovery in patients with milder acute infections and those hospitalized. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of long COVID globally and by country in 2020 and 2021 as well as the severity-weighted prevalence using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study.\\n\\nResultsAnalyses are based on detailed information for 1906 community infections and 10526 hospitalized patients from the ten collaborating cohorts, three of which included children. We added published data on 37262 community infections and 9540 hospitalized patients as well as ICD-coded medical record data concerning 1.3 million infections. Globally, in 2020 and 2021, 144.7 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 54.8-312.9) people suffered from any of the three symptom clusters of long COVID. This corresponds to 3.69% (1.38-7.96) of all infections. The fatigue, respiratory, and cognitive clusters occurred in 51.0% (16.9-92.4), 60.4% (18.9-89.1), and 35.4% (9.4-75.1) of long COVID cases, respectively. Those with milder acute COVID-19 cases had a quicker estimated recovery (median duration 3.99 months [IQR 3.84-4.20]) than those admitted for the acute infection (median duration 8.84 months [IQR 8.10-9.78]).

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for RT-PCR 3-5 days post symptom onset. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were collected using structured questionnaires from persons positive and negative for SARS-COV-2. Follow-up was performed by telephone interview to assess early outcomes and persistent symptoms. For COVID-19 cases, 5D-3L EuroQol questionnaire was used to assess the impact of symptoms on quality of life.\\n\\nResultsWe followed 814 participants (412 COVD-19 positive and 402 COVID-19 negative persons) of whom the majority (741 / 814) had mild symptoms. Both the COVID-19 positive and the COVID-19 negative groups had similar sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, except for the rate of hospitalization (15.8% vs 1.5%, respectively). One month after disease onset, 122 (29.6%) individuals reported residual symptoms in the COVID-19 positive group or the long COVID group versus 24 (6%) individuals in the COVID-19 negative group. In the long COVID group, fatigue, olfactory disorder, and myalgia were the most frequent symptoms which occurred in the acute phase.

Participants, who had experienced their initial COVID-19 episode between January, 15 2020 and May 21, 2021, were contacted 12-months post onset. Their characteristics, symptom course at initial COVID-19 episode, Long COVID phase and one year follow-up along with remission status were collected through a questionnaire and a specific post COVID remission scale from complete remission to persistence of symptoms and dependence in daily life activities.\\n\\nResultsAmong the 231 long COVID participants who answered the 12-month follow-up questionnaire, 63.2% had developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before COVID-19 vaccination. At 12-month follow-up, only 8.7% of the participants felt in complete remission while 28.6% noted a significant improvement of their symptoms. The prevalence rate of most symptoms remained high at 12 months: asthenia 83.1%, neurocognitive and neurological symptoms 91.8%, cardiothoracic symptoms 77.9%, musculoskeletal 78.8%. During Long COVID phase, 62.2% had to stop working at least once and only 32.5% resumed professional activities full time at one year follow-up. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before COVID-19 vaccination was associated with an increased probability of significant improvement at one year (aPRR: 1.60, p=0.028) while ageusia at initial Long COVID phase was associated with a lower probability of improvement (aPRR: 0.38, p=0.007).\\n\\nConclusionWhile observing a trend towards some improvement in a majority of long COVID patients at a 12-month follow-up, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, cardiothoracic symptoms and neurocognitive impairment persisted in most of them.

Patient features included in the model were selected from conditions, procedures, performance of diagnostic testing, and medications using a tree-based scan statistic approach. We used an XGboost model, with hyperparameters selected through cross-validated grid search, and model performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. Model predictions and feature importance were evaluated using Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values.\\n\\nConclusionsThe model provides a tool for identifying patients with PASC and an approach to characterizing PASC using diagnosis, medication, laboratory, and procedure features in health systems data. Using appropriate threshold settings, the model can be used to identify PASC patients in health systems data at higher precision for inclusion in studies or at higher recall in screening for clinical trials, especially in settings where PASC diagnosis codes are used less frequently or less reliably.

Using a random effects framework for meta-analysis with DerSimonian-Laird pooled inverse-variance weighted estimator, we provide an interval estimate of PASC prevalence, globally, and across regions. This meta-analysis considers variation in PASC prevalence by hospitalization status during the acute phase of infection, duration of symptoms, and specific symptom categories.\\n\\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresPrevalence of PASC worldwide and stratified by regions.\\n\\nResultsGlobal estimated pooled PASC prevalence derived from the estimates presented in 29 studies was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35, 0.63), with a higher pooled PASC prevalence estimate of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.68), among those hospitalized during the acute phase of infection. Females were estimated to have higher pooled PASC prevalence than males (0.49 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.63] versus 0.37 [95% CI: 0.24, 0.51], respectively). Regional pooled PASC prevalence estimates in descending order were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.42) for Asia, 0.44 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.59) for Europe, and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.66) for North America.

Geographic differences appear to exist, as lowest to highest PASC prevalence is observed for North America (0.30 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.66]) to Asia (0.49 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.42]). The case-mix across studies, in terms of COVID-19 severity during the acute phase of infection and variation in the clinical definition of PASC, may explain some of these differences. Nonetheless, the health effects of COVID-19 appear to be prolonged and can exert marked stress on the healthcare system, with 237M reported COVID-19 cases worldwide as of October 12, 2021.\\n\\nKey Points\\n\\nQuestionAmong those infected with COVID-19, what is the global and regional prevalence of post-acute sequelae COVID-19 (PASC)?\\n\\nFindingsGlobally, the pooled PASC prevalence estimate was 0.43, whereas the pooled PASC prevalence estimate for patients who had to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 was 0.57.

HCW with positive NPS more frequently reported [&ge;]1 symptom compared to controls (73%vs.52%, p<0.001); seropositive HCW without positive NPS did not score higher than controls (58%vs.52%, p=0.13), although impaired taste/olfaction (16%vs.6%, p<0.001) and hair loss (17%vs.10%, p=0.004) were more common. Exhaustion/burnout was reported by 24% of negative controls. Many symptoms remained elevated in those diagnosed >6 months ago; anti-S titers correlated with high symptom scores. Acute viral symptoms in weekly questionnaires best predicted long-COVID symptoms. Physical activity at baseline was negatively associated with neurocognitive impairment and fatigue scores.\\n\\nConclusionsSeropositive HCW without positive NPS are only mildly affected by long-COVID. Exhaustion/burnout is common, even in non-infected HCW.

Recently, a new COVID-19 phenotype has been noted in patients after they have ostensibly recovered from acute COVID-19 symptoms. This new syndrome is commonly termed Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here we refer to it as Long COVID/PASC. Lingering symptoms persist for as much as 6 months (or longer) after acute infection, where COVID-19 survivors complain of recurring fatigue or muscle weakness, being out of breath, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Given that blood clots can block microcapillaries and thereby inhibit oxygen exchange, we here investigate if the lingering symptoms that individuals with Long COVID/PASC manifest might be due to the presence of persistent circulating plasma clots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. We use techniques including proteomics and fluorescence microscopy to study plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with acute COVID-19, and those with Long COVID/PASC symptoms. We show that plasma samples from Long COVID/PASC still contain large anomalous (amyloid) deposits. We also show that these anomalous deposits in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC plasma samples are resistant to fibrinolysis (compared to plasma from controls and T2DM), even after trypsinisation. After a second trypsinization, the persistent pellet deposits were solubilized. We detected various inflammatory molecules that are substantially increased in both the supernatant and trapped in the solubilized pellet deposits of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC, versus the equivalent volume of fully digested fluid of the control samples. Of particular interest was a substantial increase in (2)-antiplasmin (2AP), various fibrinogen chains, as well as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) that were trapped in the solubilized fibrinolytic-resistant pellet deposits. Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might therefore benefit from following a regime of continued anticlotting therapy to support the fibrinolytic system function.', 'doi': '10.1101/2021.05.21.21257578', 'authors': 'Pretorius, E.; Vlok, M.; Venter, C.; Bezuidenhout, J.

Long COVID can also manifest as prolonged fatigue, which may be linked to neuromuscular function impairment (NMFI). The current clinical assessment for NCVI monitors neurocardiovascular performance upon the application of orthostatic stressors such as an active (i.e. self-induced) stand or a passive (tilt table) standing test. Lower limb muscle contractions may be important in orthostatic recovery via the skeletal muscle pump. In this study, adults with long COVID were assessed with a protocol that, in addition to the standard NCVI tests, incorporated simultaneous lower limb muscle monitoring for NMFI assessment. To accomplish such an investigation, a wide range of continuous non-invasive biomedical technologies were employed, including digital artery photoplethysmography for the extraction of cardiovascular signals, near-infrared spectroscopy for the extraction of regional tissue oxygenation in brain and muscle, and electromyography for assessment of timed muscle contractions in the lower limbs. With the novel technique described and exemplified in this paper, we were able to integrate signals from all instruments used in the assessment in a precisely synchronized fashion. We demonstrate that it is possible to visualize the interactions between all different physiological signals during the combined NCVI/NMFI assessment. Multiple counts of evidence were collected, which can capture the dynamics between skeletal muscle contractions and neurocardiovascular responses. The proposed multimodal data visualization can offer an overview of the functioning of the muscle pump during both supine rest and orthostatic recovery and can conduct comparison studies with signals from multiple participants at any given time in the assessment.

Traditional pathways of care for Long Term Conditions (LTCs) have tended to be managed by disease-specific specialties, an approach that has been ineffective in delivering care for patients with multi-morbidity. The multi-system nature of Long COVID and its impact on physical and psychological health demands a more effective model of holistic, integrated care. The evolution of integrated care systems (ICSs) in the UK presents an important opportunity to explore areas of mutual benefit to LTC, multi-morbidity and Long COVID care. There may be benefits in comparing and contrasting ICPs for Long COVID with ICPs for other LTCs.\\n\\nMethods and analysisThis study aims to evaluate health services requirements for ICPs for Long COVID and their applicability to other LTCs including multi-morbidity and the overlap with medically not yet explained symptoms (MNYES). The study will follow a Delphi design and involve an expert panel of stakeholders including people with lived experience, as well as clinicians with expertise in Long COVID and other LTCs. Study processes will include expert panel and moderator panel meetings, surveys, and interviews. The Delphi process is part of the overall STIMULATE-ICP programme, aimed at improving integrated care for people with Long COVID.\\n\\nEthics and disseminationEthical approval for this Delphi study has been obtained (Research Governance Board of the University of York) as have approvals for the other STIMULATE-ICP studies.

Common symptoms are fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. There is currently no effective treatment, and the underlying mechanisms are unknown although several hypotheses exist, with chronic inflammation as a common denominator. In prospective studies, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested to be effective for the treatment of similar syndromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. A case series has suggested positive effects of HBOT in Long COVID. This randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial will explore HBOT as a potential treatment for Long COVID. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBOT improves health related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with Long COVID compared to placebo/sham. The main secondary objectives are to evaluate whether HBOT improves endothelial function, objective physical performance, and short term HRQoL.\\n\\nMethods and AnalysisA randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II clinical trial in 80 previously healthy subjects debilitated due to Long COVID, with low HRQoL. Clinical data, HRQoL- questionnaires, blood samples, objective tests and activity meter data will be collected at baseline. Subjects will be randomised to a maximum of 10 treatments with hyperbaric oxygen or sham treatment over six weeks.

To address these issues, we performed a broad exploratory screening study applying state-of-the-art post-genomic profiling methods to blood plasma derived from three groups: 1) healthy individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 without exposure to the full virus, 2) asymptomatic fully recovered patients at least three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 3) symptomatic patients at least 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, here designated as Long Covid Syndrome (LCS) patients. Multiplex cytokine profiling indicated slightly elevated cytokine levels in recovered individuals in contrast to LCS patients, who displayed lowest levels of cytokines. Label-free proteome profiling corroborated an anti-inflammatory status in LCS characterized by low acute phase protein levels and a uniform down-regulation of macrophage-derived secreted proteins, a pattern also characteristic for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Along those lines, eicosanoid and docosanoid analysis revealed high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and a prevalence of anti-inflammatory oxylipins in LCS patients compared to the other study groups. Targeted metabolic profiling indicated low amino acid and triglyceride levels and deregulated acylcarnithines, characteristic for CFS and indicating mitochondrial stress in LCS patients. The anti-inflammatory osmolytes taurine and hypaphorine were significantly up-regulated in LCS patients. In summary, here we present evidence for a specific anti-inflammatory and highly characteristic metabolic signature in LCS which could serve for future diagnostic purposes and help to establish rational therapeutic interventions in these patients.\\n\\nOne sentence SummaryMulti-omics plasma analyses demonstrate anti-inflammatory and hypo-metabolic signatures in patients with Long COVID Syndrome.', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.07.11.22277499', 'authors': 'Kovarik, J.

Secondary outcomes included new symptoms, new or increased disability (Washington group short scale), breathlessness (MRC Dyspnoea scale) and quality of life (EQ5D-5L). We compared these outcome measures across age, comorbidity status and in-hospital Covid-19 severity to identify groups at highest risk of developing long-term difficulties. Multilevel logistic and linear regression models were built to adjust for the effects of patient and centre level risk factors on these outcomes.\\n\\nResultsIn total 53.7% (443/824) contacted participants responded, yielding 73.8% (327/443) responses with follow-up of 90 days or more from symptom onset. The median time between symptom onset of initial illness and completing the participant questionnaire was 222 days (Interquartile range (IQR) 189 to 269 days). In total, 54.7% (179/327) of participants reported they did not feel fully recovered. Persistent symptoms were reported by 93.3% (305/325) of participants, with fatigue the most common (82.8%, 255/308), followed by breathlessness (53.5%, 175/327). 46.8% (153/327) reported an increase in MRC dyspnoea scale of at least one grade. New or worse disability was reported by 24.2% (79/327) of participants. Overall (EQ5D-5L) summary index was significantly worse at the time of follow-up (median difference 0.1 points on a scale of 0 to 1, IQR: -0.2 to 0.0). Females under the age of 50 years were five times less likely to report feeling recovered (adjusted OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 15.74), were more likely to have greater disability (adjusted OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.94), twice as likely to report worse fatigue (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31) and seven times more likely to become more breathless (adjusted OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.24 to 22.83) than men of the same age.\\n\\nConclusionsSurvivors of Covid-19 experienced long-term symptoms, new disability, increased breathlessness, and reduced quality of life.

To identify potential therapeutic targets, we focussed on previously described four recovery clusters five months after hospital discharge, their underlying inflammatory profiles and relationship with clinical outcomes at one year.\\n\\nMethodsPHOSP-COVID is a prospective longitudinal cohort study, recruiting adults hospitalised with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs), physical performance, and organ function at five-months and one-year after hospital discharge. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at one-year. Cluster analysis was performed using clustering large applications (CLARA) k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at five-months. Inflammatory protein profiling from plasma at the five-month visit was performed.\\n\\nFindings2320 participants have been assessed at five months after discharge and 807 participants have completed both five-month and one-year visits. Of these, 35{middle dot}6% were female, mean age 58{middle dot}7 (SD 12{middle dot}5) years, and 27{middle dot}8% received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between five months 501/1965 (25{middle dot}5%) and one year 232/804 (28{middle dot}9%). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at one year were: female sex OR 0{middle dot}68 (95% CI 0{middle dot}46-0{middle dot}99), obesity OR 0{middle dot}50 (95%CI 0{middle dot}34-0{middle dot}74) and IMV OR 0{middle dot}42 (95%CI 0{middle dot}23-0{middle dot}76).\\n\\nCluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters:  very severe,  severe,  moderate/cognitive,  mild relating to the severity of physical, mental health and cognitive impairments at five months in a larger sample. There was elevation of inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate/cognitive clusters compared to the mild cluster including interleukin-6 which was elevated in both comparisons. Overall, there was a substantial deficit in median (IQR) EQ5D-5L utility index from pre-COVID (retrospective assessment) 0{middle dot}88 (0{middle dot}74-1{middle dot}00), five months 0{middle dot}74 (0{middle dot}60-0{middle dot}88) to one year: 0{middle dot}74 (0{middle dot}59-0{middle dot}88), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at one-year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters.\\n\\nInterpretationThe sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 remain substantial one year after discharge across a range of health domains with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient perceived health-related quality of life remains reduced at one year compared to pre-hospital admission.

Search terms related to COVID-19, hospitalisation and long-term follow-up were used. A large prospective cohort study from Wuhan, China (n = 1276) showed that 49% of patients reported at least one persistent symptom during a follow-up clinic visit at 12 months post COVID-19; no significant improvement in exercise capacity was observed between six- and 12-month visits. Another two large cohort studies in China (n = 2433) and Spain (n = 1950) with one-year follow-up data from telephone interviews showed that 45% and 81% of patients reported at least one residual COVID-19 symptom, respectively. However, no previous studies have compared the trajectories of COVID-19 recovery in patients classified by different clinical phenotypes, and there are no large studies investigating the relationship between systemic inflammation and ongoing health impairments post COVID-19.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyIn a diverse population of adults post-hospital admission with COVID-19, our large UK prospective multi-centre study reports several novel findings: the minority felt fully recovered at one year with minimal recovery from five months across any health domain; female sex and obesity are associated with being less likely to feel fully recovered at one year; several inflammatory mediators were increased in individuals with the most severe physical, mental health, and cognitive impairments compared to individuals with milder ongoing impairments.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceBoth pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are urgently needed to improve the ongoing burden following hospitalisation for COVID-19 both for individuals and healthcare systems; our findings support the use of a precision medicine approach with potential treatable traits of systemic inflammation and obesity.', 'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.13.21267471', 'authors': 'Evans, R.

On average, 51 training sessions (range: 10 to 251) were completed over a mean time of 435 minutes (range 78 to 2448). Most of the participants obtained higher scores after CCT in each of the domains as compared with baseline (attention: 81% of the sample; memory: 86%; coordination: 82%; perception: 88%; reasoning: 77%). The magnitude of the score increase at post-test was high across domains (attention: 31% of change; memory: 37%; coordination: 52%; perception: 42%; reasoning: 26%).

As part of a federated research study with the COVID-19 Patient Recovery Alliance, Arcadia.io performed a retrospective analysis of the medical history of 240,648 COVID-19-infected persons to identity factors influencing the development and progression of long-COVID. This analysis revealed that patients who received at least one dose of any of the three COVID vaccines prior to their diagnosis with COVID-19 were 7-10 times less likely to report two or more long-COVID symptoms compared to unvaccinated patients. Furthermore, unvaccinated patients who received their first COVID-19 vaccination within four weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 4-6 times less likely to report multiple long-COVID symptoms, and those who received their first dose 4-8 weeks after diagnosis were 3 times less likely to report multiple long-COVID symptoms compared to those who remained unvaccinated. This relationship supports the hypothesis that COVID-19 vaccination is protective against long-COVID and that effect persists even if vaccination occurs up to 12 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis.

This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2.

We categorised the healthcare access experiences of participants into five main types: 1) being unable to access primary care 2) accessing primary care but receiving (perceived) inadequate support 3) extreme persistence 4) alternatives to mainstream healthcare 5) positive experiences. There was a severe lack of access to specialist LC services. Ethnic minority participants faced a further barrier of mistrust and fear of services deterring them from accessing support. HCPs discussed systemic barriers to delivering services.

All participating sites obtained local approvals prior to recruitment. Coverscan has UKCA certification (752965). The first participant was recruited in July 2022 and interim/final results will be disseminated in 2023, in a plan co-developed with public and patient representatives. The results will be presented at national and international conferences, published in peer reviewed medical journals, and shared via media (mainstream and social) and patient support organisations.\\n\\nTrial registration numberISRCTN10665760', 'doi': '10.1101/2022.07.21.22277893', 'authors': 'Forshaw, D.; Wall, E.
